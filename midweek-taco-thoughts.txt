As it is now Wednesday and Friday is soon upon us, it is time to organize some 
thoughts regarding this weeks Friday taco.

I think I will be going for a more or less standard taco since I had pizza last Friday. Of course with guac, 
maybe some black beans. Definitely not kidney beans though.

Some pickled red jalapenos would be nice as well.

And Mango. Mango is super nice. 


I am really feeling some cravings for fish tacos coming. Potentially game changing.
